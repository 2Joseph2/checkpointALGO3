# Decision Making (if-else and switch) & Recursion

This project provides solutions to various tasks involving decision-making using `if-else` and `switch` statements, as well as recursive functions. Below are the instructions and implementations for each task.

## Instructions

### Decision Making (if-else and switch)
Choose at least 2 tasks from the following:

1. **Leap Year Checker**: Create a function that takes a year as input and determines whether it is a leap year or not. Leap years are divisible by 4, but not by 100 unless they are also divisible by 400.

2. **Ticket Pricing**: Write a program that prompts the user to enter their age and then determines the price of a movie ticket based on the following criteria:
    - Children (age <= 12): $10
    - Teenagers (age 13-17): $15
    - Adults (age >= 18): $20


### Recursion
Choose at least 2 tasks from the following:

1. **Fibonacci Sequence**: Implement a recursive function to generate the nth Fibonacci number. The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding numbers (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...).


2. **Power Function**: Write a recursive function to calculate the result of raising a number to a given power.
